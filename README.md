Employee-management-System
A robust, Spring Boot-based Employee Management System designed to streamline employee data handling, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, authentication, and REST API integration. The system is built with a modular architecture and features secure database connectivity for efficient and modern workforce management.
Key Features
Full CRUD Operations: Seamlessly manage employee records (add new employees, view, edit, and delete existing entries).
User Authentication & Authorization: Secure access to the system with role-based security (e.g., Admin, User).
RESTful API: Provides well-defined endpoints for easy integration with frontend applications or other services.
Modular Architecture: Designed for easy maintainability, scalability, and future feature expansion.
Database Integration: Persistent storage for all employee data (e.g., using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2).
Technology Stack
This project is built using the following core technologies:
Backend Framework- Spring Boot
Language - Java
Security - Spring Security
Data Access - Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
Database - MySQL

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+ (or the version specified in your pom.xml)
Maven (for dependency management and building)
A running Database Instance (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

1. Cloning the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/Patilshivanl26/Employee-management-System.git
   cd Employee-management-System

2. Configure Database Connection
   Open the src/main/resources/application.properties (or application.yml) file and update the database connection details:
    Example for MySQL
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

3. Build and Run
   You can build the project using Maven and run the resulting JAR file:
   # Package the application
     mvn clean install

   # Run the application
     java -jar target/employee-management-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The application will start on the port defined in your configuration (default is typically http://localhost:8080).

API Endpoints
The system exposes RESTful endpoints for managing data. Use tools like Postman or a client application to interact with them.

POST - /api/v1/auth/login - Log in to get an authentication token.
GET - /api/v1/employees - Retrieve a list of all employees.
POST - /api/v1/employees - Create a new employee record.
GET - /api/v1/employees/{id} - Retrieve a single employee by ID.
PUT - /api/v1/employees/{id} - Update an existing employee record.
DELETE - /api/v1/employees/{id} - Delete an employee record.
